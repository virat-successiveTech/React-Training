        Q6. Create a functional component called Clock. Use the useState hook to
        manage a state variable named time initialized to the current time. Use
        the useEffect hook to update the time state every second to display the
        current time. Render the current time in a 'p' element. When the
        component unmounts, clear the interval to stop updating the time.
