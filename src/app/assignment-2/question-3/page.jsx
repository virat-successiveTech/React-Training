        Q3. Create a functional component called ToDoList. Use the useState hook
        to manage a state variable named todos, initialized as an empty array.
        Render a list of todos using the map function. Each todo should have a
        checkbox to mark it as completed and a delete button to remove it from
        the list. Use the useState hook to manage the state of each todo item
        (completed or not).
