        Q15. Create a functional component named StudentList that displays a
        list of student names.. Define an array of student names as a constant
        within the component. Use the useMemo hook to memoize the list of
        student names. Render the list of student names on the screen. Include a
        button that, when clicked, appends a new student name to the list.
